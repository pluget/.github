# What is PluGet
PluGet is a API / Website / Repository, that main focus is to provide easy access to all of the Minecraft server plugins.
This project will help you to get the infomation about any project that you are interested in, see if it is compatible with your Minecraft server,
and download any version that has been released.

# How to contribute
If you find any bug, missing plugin etc. You can submit an issue in `pluget/repository` (for missing plugin / wrong plugin data),
or to appropriate repository to which the issue is connected to.

# Documentation
Work in progress...
You can read the READMEs in the repositories.

# Repositories
## Archived repositories
Archived repositories are the artefact of the early stage of the development process. If you want to gain more intel on how this project came to be, you can take a look, but it is very probable that you wouldn't find anything interesting in there.
